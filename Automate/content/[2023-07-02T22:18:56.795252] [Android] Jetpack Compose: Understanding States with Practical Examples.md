# [Android] Jetpack Compose: Understanding States with Practical Examples

Welcome to the world of Jetpack Compose! In this article, we will explore the concept of states and how they play a
crucial role in building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Get ready to dive into practical examples that will
help you grasp the fundamentals of using states in your Jetpack Compose applications.

### What are States in Jetpack Compose?

Before diving into practical examples, let's understand what states are in the context of Jetpack Compose. In simple
terms, states are mutable values that can be observed by the Compose framework. When a state changes, Compose
automatically recomposes the affected parts of the UI to reflect the new state.

For example, consider a button that toggles its text between "On" and "Off". In this case, the state of the button's
text is changing, and Compose takes care of updating the UI accordingly. States allow us to create dynamic and reactive
user interfaces without the need for manual UI updates.

Now that we have a basic understanding of states, let's explore some practical examples of how to use them in Jetpack
Compose.

### Using States to Manage UI Changes

States in Jetpack Compose allow us to easily manage UI changes by providing a way to represent and observe mutable
values. Let's take a look at a practical example to better understand how states work.

Suppose we have a simple counter app that increments a number every time a button is clicked. We can use a state to keep
track of the count and automatically update the UI whenever the count value changes.

Here's how we can achieve this in Jetpack Compose:

### Practical Example: Creating a Button with Toggle Text using States

Let's explore a practical example to understand how states work in Jetpack Compose. We'll create a button that toggles
its text between "On" and "Off" when clicked. Here's how you can achieve this using states in Jetpack Compose:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ToggleButton() {
    var isOn by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
    Button(onClick = { isOn = !isOn }) {
        Text(text = if (isOn) "On" else "Off")
    }
}
```

In the above code snippet, we declare a `var isOn` that represents the state of our button. Initially, it is set
to `false`. We use the `remember` function to create a mutable state that can be observed by Compose. When the button is
clicked, we toggle the value of `isOn` using the `onClick` callback. The `Text` component inside the button displays
either "On" or "Off" based on the value of `isOn`.

Now, whenever the state of `isOn` changes, Compose automatically recomposes the UI and updates the button's text to
reflect the new state. This way, we achieve a dynamic and reactive user interface without the need for manual UI
updates.

Feel free to experiment with the code and create your own custom button with different toggling text. States in Jetpack
Compose offer endless possibilities for creating interactive and engaging user interfaces!

### Exploring Different State Management Techniques in Jetpack Compose

In addition to using states, Jetpack Compose provides various other techniques to manage and handle state in your
applications. Let's take a look at some of these techniques:

1. Mutable State

Jetpack Compose offers a built-in `mutableStateOf` function that allows you to create mutable state values. This
function returns a `MutableState` object that can be observed and updated. You can use this technique when you need to
manage simple state values.

2. Derived State

Sometimes, you may need to derive a state value from one or more other state values. Jetpack Compose provides
the `derivedStateOf` function that allows you to create derived state values. With derived state, you can perform
calculations or transformations based on other state values.

3. Side Effect

In some cases, you may need to perform side effects when the state changes. Jetpack Compose provides
the `LaunchedEffect` function that allows you to handle side effects such as making network requests or updating a
database. This ensures that the side effects are executed only when the relevant state changes.

By using these different state management techniques, you can effectively control and handle state in your Jetpack
Compose applications, making them more efficient and maintainable.

### Why are States important in Jetpack Compose?

States are a fundamental concept in Jetpack Compose as they allow for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
By observing mutable values, Compose automatically recomposes the UI when a state changes. This eliminates the need for
manual UI updates and provides a reactive programming model for building UIs.

For example, consider a scenario where you have a button with changing text based on its state. When the button is
tapped, the state changes and the UI automatically updates to reflect the new state. In this way, states enable us to
build responsive and engaging user interfaces in Jetpack Compose.

### Different Approaches to State Management in Jetpack Compose

While using states is a powerful way to manage the UI changes in Jetpack Compose, there are also other approaches
available. Let's explore a few of them:

1. Mutable State:
   One of the simplest approaches to state management in Jetpack Compose is by using mutable states. Compose provides
