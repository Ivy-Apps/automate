# Functional Programming 101 in Kotlin with Code Examples

### Introduction

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and
avoids changing state and mutable data. It encourages pure functions, immutable data, and higher-order functions. In
this article, we'll explore the basics of functional programming in Kotlin with some code examples.

### Advantages of Functional Programming

Functional programming has several advantages:

- **Modularity**: Functions can be composed together, allowing for modular and reusable code.
- **Concurrency**: Functional programming makes it easier to reason about and handle concurrency because of its emphasis
  on immutability and pure functions.
- **Testability**: Pure functions are easier to test since they don't have side effects.
- **Readability**: The use of higher-order functions and lambda expressions can lead to more readable code.

In the next section, we'll look at some basic concepts of functional programming.

### Functional Programming Basics

Functional programming is based on a few core concepts:

- **Immutability**: Immutable data cannot be changed after it is created. This ensures that functions do not have side
  effects and makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the program.
- **Pure Functions**: Pure functions always produce the same output given the same inputs and do not have any side
  effects. They are independent of the external state of the program.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Higher-order functions can take other functions as parameters or return functions as
  results. This allows for a flexible and expressive way of writing code.

Now that we understand the basics of functional programming, let's dive into some code examples.

### Code Example 1

Here is an example of a simple function in Kotlin using functional programming:

```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
```

In this example, the `add` function takes two integer parameters and returns their sum. It is a pure function as it only
depends on its input and does not modify any external state.

Next, we'll explore another code example.

### Functional Programming Principles

Functional programming is guided by a set of principles:

- **First-class and Higher-order Functions**: In functional programming, functions are treated as first-class citizens,
  which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results.
  Higher-order functions, on the other hand, are functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions
  as results.
- **Pure Functions**: Pure functions are functions that produce the same output given the same inputs and do not have
  any side effects. They are independent of the external state of the program.
- **Immutability**: In functional programming, data is typically immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after it is
  created. This ensures that functions do not have side effects and makes it easier to reason about the behavior of the
  program.

Let's add more code examples to further illustrate these principles.
