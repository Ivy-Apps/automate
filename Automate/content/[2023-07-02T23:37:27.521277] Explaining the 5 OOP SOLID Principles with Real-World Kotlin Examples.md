# Explaining the 5 OOP SOLID Principles with Real-World Kotlin Examples

In object-oriented programming, the SOLID principles are fundamental guidelines that help in designing software that is
easy to understand, maintain, and extend. In this article, we will explore the five SOLID principles- Single
Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and
Dependency Inversion Principle. Through real-world examples in Kotlin, we will explain each principle and illustrate how
they can be applied in practice. Let's dive in!

### Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a
class should have only one responsibility or job. This principle promotes a high level of cohesion and reduces the
coupling between classes.

For example, let's say we have a `Person` class that has both data fields and methods to perform calculations on those
fields. This violates the SRP because the class has two responsibilities - managing data and performing calculations. It
would be better to separate these responsibilities into two separate classes: `Person` for data management
and `Calculator` for performing calculations.

```kotlin
class Person(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int
)

class Calculator {
    fun calculateAgeInDays(person: Person): Int {
        // perform calculation
    }
}
```

### Open Closed Principle

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for
extension but closed for modification. This means that we should be able to add new functionality to a system without
modifying its existing code.

For example, let's consider a simple scenario where we have a `Shape` class hierarchy. Each shape has a `draw` method
that defines how it is drawn on the screen. Now, suppose we want to add a new shape to our system, such as a `Triangle`.
Instead of modifying the existing code for the `Shape` class and its subclasses, we can create a new subclass `Triangle`
and implement the `draw` method specifically for triangles.

```kotlin
abstract class Shape {
    abstract fun draw()
}

class Circle : Shape() {
    override fun draw() {
        // draw a circle
    }
}

class Rectangle : Shape() {
    override fun draw() {
        // draw a rectangle
    }
}

class Triangle : Shape() {
    override fun draw() {
        // draw a triangle
    }
}
```

### Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its
subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, derived classes should be able to
substitute their base classes without causing any unexpected behavior.

### Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not
use. This principle encourages creating smaller, focused interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

For example, let's consider a scenario where we have an `Animal` interface with methods like `fly()`, `swim()`,
and `walk()`. Now, suppose we have a `Bird` class that implements the `Animal` interface. Since a bird can fly,
the `Bird` class would have a method implementation for `fly()`.

However, consider the case of a `Fish` class that also implements the `Animal` interface. Since a fish cannot fly,
the `fly()` method implementation in the `Fish` class would be empty or throw an exception. This violates the ISP
because the `Fish` class is depending on an interface method (`fly()`) that it does not use.

To adhere to the ISP, we can split the `Animal` interface into smaller interfaces like `Flyable` and `Swimmable`. Then,
the `Bird` class can implement the `Flyable` interface, while the `Fish` class can implement the `Swimmable` interface.

```kotlin
interface Flyable {
    fun fly()
}

interface Swimmable {
    fun swim()
}

class Bird : Flyable {
    override fun fly() {
        // fly implementation
    }
}

class Fish : Swimmable {
    override fun swim() {
        // swim implementation
    }
}
```
