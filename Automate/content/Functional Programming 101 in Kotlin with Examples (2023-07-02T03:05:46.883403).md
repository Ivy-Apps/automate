# Functional Programming 101 in Kotlin with Examples

## What is Functional Programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm...

## Why use Functional Programming?

Functional Programming offers several benefits:

- Improved code readibility
- Easier debugging
- Better code reusability
- Enhanced scalability and maintainability

## How Functional Programming Works

Functional programming works by treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoiding changing
state and mutable data. It focuses on immutability, high-order functions, and declarative programming.

## Functional Programming Principles

Functional programming is based on several principles:

- Immutability: Data cannot be changed once it is created.
- Pure functions: Functions that always return the same output for the same input and do not have side effects.
- Higher-order functions: Functions that can take other functions as parameters or return functions as results.
- Recursion: A programming technique where a function calls itself.
