# OOP vs FP: Exploring Solid Principles and Core Principles in Kotlin

In the world of software development, two prominent paradigms have emerged: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and
Functional Programming (FP). While both approaches have their merits, they have fundamental differences in their
principles and design concepts. In this article, we will delve into the core principles and best practices of OOP and
FP, with a focus on Kotlin as the programming language of choice. Join us as we explore the Solid principles of OOP and
the foundational principles of FP, and discover how they shape the way we write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

### Solid Principles in Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code around objects, which can be
thought of as the building blocks of our software systems. OOP follows a set of principles known as the SOLID
principles, which provide guidelines for designing and implementing clean and maintainable code. Let's explore each of
these principles in detail and see how they contribute to the overall quality of our OOP code.

### Core Principles of Functional Programming

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and the absence of
side effects. FP introduces a set of core principles that guide developers in writing functional code. Let's take a
closer look at these principles and understand their significance in the world of functional programming.

### The SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code around objects, which can be
thought of as the building blocks of our software systems. OOP follows a set of principles known as the SOLID
principles, which provide guidelines for designing and implementing clean and maintainable code. Let's explore each of
these principles in detail and see how they contribute to the overall quality of our OOP code.

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a
   class should have a single responsibility or job. This principle helps us create classes that are focused and
   cohesive, making them easier to understand, test, and maintain. For example, consider a `User` class that handles
   user authentication. If we later decide to add user registration functionality, the class should not be modified to
   accommodate this new responsibility. Instead, we can create a separate `Registration` class that handles user
   registration, adhering to the SRP.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   The Open/Closed Principle states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. This
   principle promotes the idea of writing code that is easily extensible without modifying existing code. By adhering to
   this principle, we can introduce new behavior or features by extending classes rather than modifying their existing
   code. For instance, consider a `Shape` class with a `calculateArea` method. If we later want to add a new shape, such
   as a `Circle`, we can create a new class that inherits from `Shape` and overrides the `calculateArea` method to
   provide the specific implementation for circles without modifying the existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its
   subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should be able to substitute
   their parent classes without causing any unexpected behavior. This principle ensures that the behavior defined by the
   superclass is preserved by its subclasses. For example, consider a `Vehicle` superclass with a
   method `startEngine()`. If we have a `Car` subclass, calling the `startEngine()` method should start the car's engine
   without any issues, as expected from a vehicle.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   This principle encourages the segregation of interfaces into smaller and more focused units, allowing clients to
   depend only on the interfaces that are relevant to them. This helps prevent the problem of interface pollution and
   promotes better code modularity. For example, consider an `Employee` interface that has methods related to both
   payroll calculations and performance evaluations. Instead of having a single interface, we can split it into two
   interfaces: `PayrollCalculations` and `PerformanceEvaluations`, allowing clients to depend only on the interface they
   require.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
   depend on abstractions. This principle promotes loose coupling and allows for easier maintenance and testing of code.
   By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, we can easily replace one implementation with
   another without affecting the higher-level modules. For example, consider a `ReportGenerator` class that depends on a
   specific database implementation. By introducing an abstraction, such as a `Database` interface, and making
   the `ReportGenerator` depend on the interface rather than the specific database implementation, we can switch to a
   different database implementation without modifying the `ReportGenerator` class.

By following these SOLID principles, we can create object-oriented code that is modular, flexible, and easier to
understand and maintain. Now, let's shift our focus to the core principles of Functional Programming (FP).

Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and the absence of
side effects. FP introduces a set of core principles that guide developers in writing functional code. Let's take a
