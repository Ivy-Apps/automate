# Functional programming 101 in Kotlin with code examples

### Introduction to Functional Programming

Functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and declarative style of programming.
It aims to avoid changing state and mutable data, making code more predictable and easier to understand.

In Kotlin, we have various functions and features that facilitate functional programming. Let's dive into some of the
fundamentals.

### Benefits of Functional Programming

Functional programming offers several benefits:

- **Modularity**: Functions are independent units that can be combined and reused.
- **Readability**: With immutability and pure functions, code becomes more readable and easier to reason about.
- **Concurrency**: Pure functions make it easier to reason about and parallelize code.
- **Testability**: Pure functions are easier to test since they don't have side effects.

In the next section, we will explore these benefits in more detail.

### Functional programming principles

Functional programming is based on a few key principles:

- **Immutability**: Data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once created.
- **Pure functions**: Functions that always return the same output for the same input, with no side effects.
- **Higher-order functions**: Functions that can take other functions as parameters or return functions.

Understanding these principles is essential for writing functional code.

### Key Features of Kotlin

Kotlin is a modern programming language that has gained popularity among developers for its concise syntax and powerful
features:

- **Null Safety**: Kotlin has built-in null safety features that help eliminate null pointer exceptions.
- **Extension Functions**: Kotlin allows you to extend existing classes with new functions, without modifying their
  source code.
- **Coroutines**: Kotlin provides built-in support for asynchronous programming with coroutines, making it easier to
  write concurrent code.

In the next section, we will explore these features in more detail.
