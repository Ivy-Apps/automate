# Svelte for beginners: Build your first reactive website with real-world code examples

Svelte is a powerful JavaScript framework that allows you to build reactive websites with ease. In this article, we will
explore the basics of Svelte and guide you through the process of creating your first website using real-world code
examples. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how Svelte works and be able to create
dynamic and interactive web applications.

### Introduction to Svelte

Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that allows you to build reactive web applications with ease. It's gaining
popularity among web developers due to its simplicity and performance. In this article, we will guide you through the
process of building your first Svelte website, while providing real-world code examples to help you understand the
concepts better.

### Why Choose Svelte?

There are several reasons why you should consider using Svelte for your web development projects. First, it offers a
simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn and use. Unlike other frameworks that rely on virtual DOM
diffing, Svelte compiles your code to highly efficient JavaScript that directly manipulates the DOM, resulting in better
performance. Additionally, Svelte's reactive programming model allows you to easily create dynamic user interfaces
without the need for complex state management libraries. In the next section, we'll dive deeper into the key features of
Svelte and how they can benefit you in building your first reactive website.

### Setting up a Svelte project

Before we dive into building our first reactive website with Svelte, let's first set up our development environment.
Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install Node.js if you don't have it already. You can download it from the official Node.js website.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Svelte project template:

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
```

3. Change into the newly created project directory:

```bash
cd svelte-app
```

4. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Finally, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now that our project is set up, let's move on to the next section where we'll explore the basics of Svelte programming.

### Creating a Svelte Component

In Svelte, components are the building blocks of an application. They are reusable and encapsulate code and data, making
it easier to manage and maintain your application.

To create a Svelte component, start by creating a new file with the .svelte extension. This file will contain your
component's code and markup.

Here's an example of a simple Svelte component that displays a button:

```svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;

  function increment() {
    count += 1;
  }
</script>

<button on:click={increment}>
  Clicked {count} times
</button>
```

In the above code, we define a variable called `count` and a function called `increment` inside the `<script>` tag.
The `count` variable keeps track of the number of times the button is clicked, and the `increment` function increases
the count by one.

Next, we use the `<button>` element to create a clickable button. We bind the `increment` function to the `on:click`
event so that every time the button is clicked, the `increment` function is called.

Finally, we display the current value of `count` inside the button text using curly braces `{}`. This is a feature of
Svelte called reactive statements, which automatically update the DOM whenever the value of a reactive variable changes.

This is just a simple example to get you started with Svelte components. In the next section, we'll explore more
advanced concepts and techniques for building interactive Svelte applications.
