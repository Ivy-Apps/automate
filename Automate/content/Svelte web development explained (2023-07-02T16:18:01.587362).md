# Svelte web development explained

### Why Svelte?

Before we dive into the code examples, let's take a moment to understand why Svelte is a great choice for web
development. Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that focuses on building highly performant and efficient web
applications. Unlike other frameworks that rely on a virtual DOM, Svelte compiles your components into highly optimized
JavaScript code during build time. This means that there is no runtime overhead and your application runs faster on the
client's browser. Additionally, Svelte has a small learning curve and provides a simple and intuitive syntax, making it
easy for developers to get started.

### Installing Svelte

To get started with Svelte, you need to first install it. Fortunately, installing Svelte is straightforward. You can
either use a package manager like npm or yarn, or include the Svelte script directly in your HTML file. Let me show you
an example of how to install Svelte using npm:

```shell
$ npm install svelte
```

After installing Svelte, you can import it into your project and start building your web application.

### Creating a Svelte Component

One of the key features of Svelte is its component-based architecture. With Svelte, you can easily create reusable UI
components that encapsulate their own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic. Let's see an example of creating a Svelte
component:

```svelte
<script>
  let name = 'World';
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>

<style>
  h1 {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
  }
</style>
```

### Components in Svelte

In Svelte, components play a crucial role in organizing and structuring your web application. They are reusable building
blocks that encapsulate their own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic. Let's explore how to create and use components in
Svelte:
