# Svelte 101 in 5 minutes with many code examples.

### What is Svelte?

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. It's a compiler that takes your declarative components and
compiles them into efficient, imperative code that updates the DOM. This results in smaller bundle sizes, faster runtime
performance, and an incredibly smooth developer experience. In this article, we will explore the basics of Svelte and
learn how to get started in just 5 minutes.

### Why Svelte?

There are many JavaScript frameworks out there, so you might be wondering why you should choose Svelte. Well, Svelte
offers several advantages over other frameworks. For example, it compiles your components into highly optimized code
that runs directly in the browser, resulting in faster load times and better performance. Additionally, Svelte's
reactivity system is more efficient than traditional virtual DOM implementations, making your applications feel snappy
and responsive. In this section, we'll explore some of the reasons why you should consider using Svelte for your next
project.

### Getting Started with Svelte

To get started with Svelte, you'll first need to install it globally on your machine using the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g svelte
```

Once Svelte is installed, you can create a new Svelte project by running the following command:

```bash
$ svelte create my-project
```

This will create a new directory called `my-project` with the basic structure of a Svelte project. Navigate to the
project directory and run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
$ cd my-project
$ npm run dev
```

You can now open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see your Svelte app
running. Congratulations, you've successfully set up Svelte and created your first project!

### Svelte Components

One of the key concepts in Svelte is components. Components are reusable chunks of code that encapsulate functionality
and UI elements. They help in creating modular and maintainable code. To create a component in Svelte, you need to
define a `.svelte` file. Let's create a simple `Button` component:

```svelte
<script>
  export let text = 'Click me';
  export let handleClick = () => {};
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>{text}</button>
```

In the code above, we define a component named `Button`. It accepts two props: `text` and `handleClick`. The prop `text`
specifies the button's text, and `handleClick` is a function that gets called when the button is clicked. We bind
the `handleClick` function to the `click` event of the button. This way, when the button is clicked, the function gets
called.

### Svelte Syntax

One of the things that makes Svelte stand out is its simple and concise syntax. With Svelte, you write your components
using a syntax that closely resembles regular HTML and JavaScript. Let's take a look at an example:

```svelte
<script>
  let name = 'World';
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```

In the code above, we define a variable `name` that is initially set to 'World'. We then use curly braces `{}` to
include the value of the `name` variable inside the `<h1>` tag. This way, when the component is rendered, it will
display 'Hello World!'.

### Key Features of Svelte

Svelte has several key features that make it a popular choice for building web applications. Let's explore some of these
features:

1. **Declarative Syntax**: Svelte uses a declarative syntax that allows developers to describe the desired UI state and
   let Svelte handle the updates.

2. **Reactivity**: Svelte's reactivity system automatically updates the DOM based on changes to the underlying data,
   making it easy to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

3. **Component-based Architecture**: Svelte promotes a component-based architecture, where UI elements are encapsulated
   into reusable components. This helps improve code organization and maintainability.

4. **Efficient Code Generation**: Svelte compiles the components at build time, generating highly efficient JavaScript
   code that runs directly in the browser. This results in faster loading times and better performance.

5. **CSS Scoped Styles**: Svelte allows you to write scoped styles for your components, ensuring that the styles do not
   bleed into other parts of your application. This helps in avoiding style conflicts and makes it easier to manage the
   styles.

With these key features, Svelte provides developers with a powerful and efficient framework for building modern web
applications.

### Imperative vs Declarative

One of the key concepts in Svelte is the shift from imperative programming to declarative programming. In imperative
programming, developers specify how to achieve a particular result by providing step-by-step instructions. However, in
declarative programming, developers describe the desired outcome and let the framework handle the implementation
details.

This declarative approach in Svelte allows developers to focus on what they want to achieve rather than how to achieve
it. This not only makes the code easier to read and understand but also simplifies the development process.

### Why Choose Svelte?

There are several reasons why developers choose Svelte as their framework for building web applications:

1. **Lightweight**: Svelte is a lightweight framework that minimizes the amount of code required to build applications.
   This leads to faster loading times and improved performance.

2. **Easy to Learn**: Svelte has a simple and intuitive syntax that is easy to learn, especially for developers familiar
   with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3. **Efficient DOM Updates**: Svelte's reactivity system updates the DOM efficiently by only modifying the parts that
   have changed. This results in faster rendering and better user experience.

4. **Great Developer Experience**: Svelte provides a great developer experience with features like hot module
   replacement, real-time previews, and a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries.

By considering these factors, developers can make an informed decision when choosing Svelte as their framework of
choice.

### Hot Module Replacement

One of the great features of Svelte is Hot Module Replacement (HMR). HMR allows developers to see changes to their code
reflected in the browser in real-time without the need to manually refresh the page. This significantly improves the
development workflow and saves time.
