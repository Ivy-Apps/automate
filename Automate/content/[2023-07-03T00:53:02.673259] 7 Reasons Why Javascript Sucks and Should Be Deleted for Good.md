# 7 Reasons Why Walter White Hates Javascript and IT Should Be Deleted for Good

You're god damn right! Let's talk about why Javascript sucks and why it should be deleted once and for all. I am the
danger!!!

### Reason 1: Inconsistent Syntax

One of the main reasons why Javascript sucks is its inconsistent syntax. It's like having a chemistry set where every
time you mix two chemicals, they produce a different result. I mean, come on! How can anyone trust a language where
simple things like adding two numbers can lead to unexpected outcomes? It's enough to drive someone to the edge of
madness, just like cooking meth with an unpredictable recipe. And you know what they say, if you don't get the syntax
right, you're gonna blow up in your face! Trust me, I've been there. So, let's delete Javascript and say goodbye to this
syntax nightmare once and for all!

### Reason 2: Callback Hell

Another reason why Javascript sucks is the notorious Callback Hell. It's like being trapped in a never-ending loop of
callbacks, just like Walter White's blue meth gaining popularity in the drug world. You start with a simple asynchronous
operation, and before you know it, you're nesting callbacks within callbacks within callbacks. It's a nightmare to read,
understand, and maintain. It's like trying to keep track of a complex money laundering scheme. You never know where one
callback ends and another begins. Let's face it, callback hell is a living hell. We need to delete Javascript and escape
this never-ending loop of pain and confusion.

### Reason 3: Global Scope Woes

One of the biggest headaches with Javascript is its handling of global scope. It's as if every variable you declare
becomes a ticking time bomb, ready to explode and cause unexpected bugs. Just like Walter White's hidden stash of money,
global variables in Javascript can wreak havoc on your code. They can be accessed and modified from anywhere, leading to
potential conflicts and security vulnerabilities. It's like having a secret empire built on a foundation of ashes. We
need to delete Javascript and say goodbye to these global scope woes once and for all!

### Reason 4: Lack of Strong Typing

One of the reasons why Javascript sucks is its lack of strong typing. It's like attempting to navigate through a desert
without a map or a compass. You never know what you're dealing with until it's too late. Just like Walter White's
unpredictable personality, Javascript's lack of strong typing leaves room for errors and surprises. You can assign a
value of any type to a variable without any warnings or errors, leading to runtime errors that could have easily been
caught during compilation. It's like walking on thin ice, always wondering if the next step will be your last. We need a
language that provides a solid foundation, one that keeps us safe and gives us the confidence to explore new
possibilities. It's time to delete Javascript and find a language that takes strong typing seriously.

### Reason 5: Insecure by Design

Let's talk about how Javascript is insecure by design. It's like leaving your secret formula for cooking meth out in the
open for everyone to see. Javascript's loose typing and lack of proper security measures make it vulnerable to attacks
like cross-site scripting (XSS) and code injections. Just like how Jesse Pinkman's loose lips got him into trouble with
the law, Javascript's insecure design opens the door for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise user data. We
need a language that prioritizes security and protects our code from malicious intent. It's time to delete Javascript
and choose a language that takes security seriously.

### Reason 6: Poor Performance

One of the key reasons why Javascript sucks is its poor performance. It's like trying to cook crystal meth in a rusty
and old RV, hoping for a good yield. Javascript is notorious for its slow execution speed, making it the tortoise in the
programming race. Just like how Walter White's RV was barely holding up, Javascript struggles with handling large
amounts of data efficiently. It's time to step up our game and choose a language that can keep up with the demands of
modern web development. Say goodbye to the sluggishness of Javascript and embrace a language that can make your code run
like a well-oiled machine.

### Reason 7: Lack of Modularity

Moving on to reason number 7 why Javascript sucks: its lack of modularity. You know, just like how Walter White's
operation would fall apart without the proper distribution channels. In Javascript, it's a mess trying to manage
dependencies and organize code into reusable and maintainable modules. Everything is thrown together in one big pile,
like a messy trailer full of cookware and chemicals. It's hard to keep track of what does what and where it's coming
from. We need a language that promotes modularity and allows us to easily manage and reuse code. It's time to delete
Javascript and embrace a language that embraces modularity.

### Reason 8: Confusing Scoping Rules

Let's dive into reason number 8 why Javascript sucks: its confusing scoping rules. Just like Walter White's elaborate
schemes, Javascript's scoping can leave you scratching your head and wondering what went wrong. The way variables are
defined and accessed in different contexts can be a nightmare to understand. It's like trying to decipher a cryptic
message from Jesse Pinkman. You never know if a variable is in the global scope, function scope, or blocked scope. It's
a game of hide and seek that can lead to unexpected bugs and errors. We need a language with clear and consistent
scoping rules, one that doesn't leave us feeling lost and confused. It's time to delete Javascript and choose a language
that can bring order to the chaos of scoping.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, it's clear that Javascript has its fair share of flaws and frustrations. From its inconsistent syntax to
the nightmare of callback hell, the global scope woes, and the lack of strong typing, Javascript has proven to be a
language that can drive even the most seasoned developers to the edge of madness. Add in its insecure design, poor
performance, lack of modularity, and confusing scoping rules, and you've got a recipe for disaster.

But fear not, my fellow developers! We have the power to change our programming landscape. We can say goodbye to
Javascript and embrace a language that offers more reliable syntax, avoids the callback hell, enforces strong typing,
prioritizes security, delivers better performance, promotes modularity, and provides clear and consistent scoping rules.

Just like Walter White transformed from a meek chemistry teacher to the infamous Heisenberg, we can transform our code
by making the right choices. Let's choose a language that doesn't suck, a language that allows us to focus on our
creativity and problem-solving skills rather than dealing with the shortcomings of Javascript.

So, my fellow developers, it's time to raise our beakers and say goodbye to Javascript once and for all. Let's step into
a bright future where our code is elegant, efficient, and reliable. Together, we can make the programming world a better
place.

Remember, you're god damn right! Choose wisely, and may your code be flawless. I am the danger!!!
